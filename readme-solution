ip address: 35.231.133.191 

Below are steps I have taken to resolve the issues mentioned in the test

1) sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf 
add this to the nginx.conf server block


server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;

        listen 443 ssl;

        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html index.htm;

        server_name ravelin.com;
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}

2) edit /etc/hosts file and remove the line related to api.ravelin.com
3) add new user ravelin with command

sudo adduser ravelin

add ravelin to sudo users group by using the below command

sudo usermod -aG sudo ravelin

Edit ssh config: 
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Change this line:
PasswordAuthentication no
to
PasswordAuthentication yes
and also update 
PermitRootLogin without-password
Restart daemon: 
sudo systemctl restart sshd

create key pairs using sshkeygen and then sudo nano id_rsa.pub , paste the public key given in the github link provided for the test

then ssh-copy-id -i root@@35.231.133.191

then from terminal try ssh ravelin@35.231.133.191

4) try commands such as uptime and top to check the cpu load and performance and take necessary action

5) run the command to list all id's

sudo ufw status numbered

then delete the rule with the id. In our case type the following command:

sudo ufw delete 4

proceed with operation (y/n) : y

Repeat the above command 2 more times to delete all deny rules for the Tuvalu IP addresses

6) Was unable to resolve the https://api.github.com issue
